## future releases:
* Need to profile code as the responsiveness isn't where it should be
* API -- are function names clear enough? Lots of styles used: camel case (R
functions) Upper camel case (Traits), underscore proto methods. Is
this confusing enough?
* Need to tidy up code base, finish documentation
* Add more item types:
  + implement formula item
  + implement data frame edit item
  + implement more items: vectors?
* make work with gWidgets[WWW|tcltk]. For now (0.4 version) we
automatically load RGtk2, as a convenience, but if these get resolved,
we will put that into suggests.

The tcltk issue is that the blockHandler/unblockHandler, tag<- stuff
needs to be implemented. 

For gWidgetsWWW, there are issues in how we
store values from the web -> R. We place into a variable
(.gWidgetsIDX) which does not trigger the model to notify observers,
as the gWidgetsWWW object doesn't not now about this, until it has its
svalue() method called. This is likely not going to resolve.
